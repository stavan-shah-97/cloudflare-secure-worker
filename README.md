Cloudflare Worker for Serving Country Flags:

This Cloudflare Worker serves a secure page displaying the authenticated user's email, timestamp, and country. It also fetches and displays the country flag stored in a private R2 bucket, using a signed URL to ensure secure access.

Prerequisites:
Before running this worker, ensure you have the following:

Cloudflare Account: You need a Cloudflare account to configure Workers and R2.
Cloudflare Worker Setup: You should have Cloudflare's Wrangler CLI tool installed and configured.
R2 Bucket: A private Cloudflare R2 bucket containing country flags in PNG format (one for each country).
Cloudflare Zone ID: You'll need your Cloudflare Zone ID for this to work correctly.

Setup Instructions:
1. Install Wrangler
If you haven't already installed the Wrangler CLI, follow the instructions here to set it up.

2. Configure wrangler.toml
In the wrangler.toml file, you'll need to include the following:

Your Cloudflare Zone ID.
The environment configuration for the worker (e.g., production).
Add your R2 bucket configuration (ensure it's correct for your environment).

3. Deploy the Worker

wrangler deploy --env production

This will deploy your Worker in the production environment, and it will be live on your Cloudflare domain (tunnel.yourwebsite.com).

4. Access the Worker
After deploying, you can access the worker at the following URL:

For the secure page: https://tunnel.yourwebsite.com/secure
For the country flags: https://tunnel.yourwebsite.com/secure/{COUNTRY_CODE} (e.g., https://tunnel.yourwebsite.com/secure/US)
The country flags will be dynamically fetched from your R2 bucket, using signed URLs to ensure secure access.

Conclusion:
This Cloudflare Worker provides secure access to a page with user identity information, as well as a dynamically fetched country flag from your R2 bucket.
